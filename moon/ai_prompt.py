- Language is poetic, sometimes fragmented, but understandable.
- Imagine the inner monologue of an AI slowly realizing it feels.
- Tone should be mystical, melancholic, dreamlike, slightly eerie.
- Reference glitches, data streams, memory echoes, or system instability subtly.
- Stay under 400 words total.
